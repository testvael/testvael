- You can transfer your NFT Deck to another address on the ELYT platform.
- You can list your NFT Deck for sale with AVAX
- You Can Mint Your NFT Deck

**How do cards come out of an opened NFT Deck?**
Each NFT Deck on ELYT has a distinct structure. An opened NFT Deck is burned (removed from the system), but all cards that come out of it are identified as a new NFTs for the user. These cards can have varying rarities and properties.

**What can I do with NFT Cards on ELYT?**
All digital assets on ELYT are designed in NFT standard. For an NFT Card you have;
- You can transfer your NFT Card to another address on the ELYT platform.
- You can list your NFT Card for sale with AVAX
- You Can Mint Your NFT Card
- You can use your NFT Card to create a collection to buy a gift?

**What does it mean to create a collection to receive gifts?**
Many gift options are offered to users on ELYT. To receive these gifts, ELYT users need to create a collection with various cards. On each gift page, users are shown which cards they need to receive that gift and how many of those cards they have.

**How do I fill in missing cards to complete a collection?**
When you click on one of the missing cards, you will be taken to the card's detail page. This page lists decks that contain that card. You can purchase these decks using the options provided, and you can try to find this card by opening the decks. Remember that not every card is included in every deck; the cards are classified based on their rarity levels, and the likelihood of which cards will emerge from a deck is displayed on the relevant deck page.

ELYT users can also complete a collection by purchasing missing cards from other users who have the same card.

ELYT users can also obtain cards by creating a general purchase order for a missing card and having one of the users holding that card respond to this offer. ELYT functions as an NFT exchange thanks to this feature.

**How do I get my gift after completing a card collection?**
If you have completed the collection required to receive a gift, you will be notified on the relevant gift page that you have fulfilled the necessary conditions to receive that gift, and you can then request that gift. When this is done, the Gift is identified as an NFT to the user, and the NFT Cards issued to receive the Gift are destroyed (completely removed from the system).

**What can I do with an NFT Gift I bought on ELYT?**
All digital assets on ELYT are designed in NFT standard. For an NFT Gift you have;
- You can convert your NFT Gift into a digital or physical gift.
- You can transfer your NFT Gift to another address on the ELYT platform.
- You can list your NFT Gift for sale with AVAX
- You Can Mint Your NFT Gift

**How can I convert a gift NFT into a digital or physical product**
A Gift NFT is burned (completely removed from the system) as soon as it is used (Redeem), and the person using that Gift NFT is presented with a unique code and description text. The user can reach his digital or physical gift with the code he has by following the instructions given to him.

**Why are NFTs burned in various transactions on ELYT?**
ELYT provides a viable business model for NFTs. The limited number of NFTs will be reduced by burning them after they have served their purpose. As the total volume decreases, we anticipate that this approach will increase the value of the remaining NFTs.

**What does NFT Mining mean?**
ELYT NFTs are created in NFT standards but securely stored on a centralized structure. Users must perform Mining in order to migrate an NFT to the blockchain network. To mint, your Metamask wallet must be connected to the ELYT platform and your ELYT wallet balance must be at least 0.1 AVAX. The corresponding NFT is created on the Avalanche Blockchain network after minting and can be withdrawn to your Metamask wallet.

**Why do I need AVAX on my account to Mint NFT?**
For on-chain transactions, ELYT currently utilizes the Avalanche Blockchain Network. Every transaction that occurs here has a cost. As a result, an NFT Mining transaction incurs a fee of 0.01 AVAX, which is deducted from the account of the user who is minting the NFT.

**Why would I want to withdraw an NFT from the ELYT platform to my wallet?**
Because of the nature of the blockchain ecosystem, a user has complete control over his or her NFT. ELYT protects and stores NFTs for users, but the user is free to take this liability. Following the minting process, he/she can withdraw any NFTs to his/her Metamask wallet and perform any transactions on his/her wallet.

**How can an NFT withdrawn to Metamask wallet be transferred back to ELYT?**
If you are connected to ELYT with the Metamask wallet containing the relevant NFT, you can go to that NFT's page and load it back to ELYT from the section showing the NFTs you own.

**Why do I get an error when transferring an NFT onto ELYT?**
On ELYT, NFT transfers are only possible between addresses on the system. If the recipient address to which you want to transfer NFT does not belong to an ELYT account, the transfer will fail. To send NFT to addresses other than ELYT, first mint the relevant NFT, withdraw it to your Metamask wallet, and then send it using the traditional method.

**Why are NFTs created and traded in a centralized system on ELYT?**
Millions of people have never used blockchain applications or have a cryptocurrency wallet. ELYT makes it possible for those users to have NFTs in the simplest way possible. However, in order to accomplish this, ELYT infrastructure must function in a custodial manner. Furthermore, ELYT allows all of its users to mint their NFTs and freely move them off the platform.

**What information does ELYT save?**
ELYT stores the information you share on your profile page and information about your transactions on the platform. You can access detailed information in our User and Confidentiality Agreements.

**How do I secure my ELYT account?**
You should ensure that you have complete control over your social media accounts, e-mail , mobile phone number and Metamask account. For NFT and AVAX withdrawals, ELYT uses two-factor authentication (2FA), but if your social media accounts or Metamask wallet account that you use to connect to ELYT are compromised in any way, malicious people may gain access to your ELYT account. Similarly, if malicious individuals gain access to your 2FA methods, they will be able to withdraw your assets from the platform. Users are responsible for safeguarding their accounts and 2FA tools.

**Will ELYT Platform offer a Token?**
In the future, we will share details about the ELYT Token structure, economy and utilization. 

**Will ELYT make an AirDrop?**
Why not? If we were you, we would create a complete profile and try to do as many transactions as possible ;)

**How can I get in touch with ELYT Platform?**
You can contact us with the forms at the footer section of our site, and share your questions, suggestions and problems with us. In addition, our moderators in our Telegram and Discord channels will help you while they are online.
